This is the final project of Coursera's Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing.
In this project I built a binary image classification model to detect STOP vs NO-STOP signs using a pretrained ResNet18 model.
Applied data augmentation and dataset splitting to handle a small dataset.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy and visualized predictions to interpret results.
Dataset used in this project: https://github.com/mbasilyan/Stop-Sign-Detection
