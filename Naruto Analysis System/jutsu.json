More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body.

As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.\n[\n3\n]\n The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise. He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled \nSharingan\n user like \nSasuke Uchiha\n,\n[\n4\n]\n and a highly trained \nswordsman\n like \nSuigetsu Hōzuki\n, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.\n[\n5\n]\n Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.\n[\n6\n]\n\n\nThe swords can be \ncharged\n with \nlightning\n \nchakra\n to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.\n[\n7\n]\n Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.\n[\n8\n]\n In the anime Killer B was able to use the \nEight-Tails\n' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.\n[\n9\n]"

Following a common depiction of Asura, this ability allows the user to possess six arms and three faces, each of which display a different emotion. Like Deva, Asura are also a race of supernatural beings. They are also featured in Hinduism as divine beings, and are known to live a life pursuing power, while indulgent and representative of materialistic and carnal pleasures. Both depictions play in the abilities of the Asura Path.\n\nIt also draws inspiration from Hinduism, where Asuras in mythology purportedly had the ability (called \nAstra\n) to use magical equivalents to modern day biological missiles.\n\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nFourth Databook, page 257\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 551, page 6"

It has the same five second limit as the Shinra Tensei as stated by \nChōji Akimichi\n.\n[\n2\n]\n The area of effect can be localised, so it is possible to selectively attract a target or targets without affecting the object or the structure they're connected to.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n It is also possible to attract multiple targets at once, causing them to collide with each other.\n[\n4\n]\n The ability to manipulate attractive forces with this technique is granted by the \nDeva Path\n much like its counterpart \nShinra Tensei\n.\n\n\n\nOther Media\n[\n]\n\n\nAn enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of Banshō Ten'in appears in \nNaruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble\n, called \"Banshō Ten'in: Dōmetsu\" (\n万象天引・導滅\n, \nliterally meaning:\n Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Guiding Destruction).\n\nIn \nNaruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Impact\n, Nagato can also use it to lift the ground and throw it at the opponent, called \"Banshō Ten'in: Jidō\" (\n万象天引・地動\n, \nliterally meaning:\n Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Ground Motion).\n\n\n\nInfluence\n[\n]\n\n\nThe names of Banshō Ten'in and its companion ability, \nShinra Tensei\n, are derived from \nShinra Banshō\n (\n神羅万象\n, \nliterally meaning:\n Everything Covered by God), a Japanese \nfour-character idiom\n and homophone variant of \nShinra Banshō\n (\n森羅万象\n, \nliterally meaning:\n All-Covering Forests and Ten Thousand Things), a Buddhist idiom which has come to mean \"All Nature\" or \"All Creation\"."

By using the toad's tongue to drag in whatever it wraps around, this technique is best used to capture and isolate a victim dragging them into the toad's stomach. Isolated from the outside world by a barrier, the dimension sealed inside the Gourd Toad's stomach is far larger than the size of the Gourd Toad itself. Even if at a moment's notice, only the technique's caster can freely enter and exit the isolated space. Should the need arise, the toad can be used to transport whatever it has captured, releasing its contents when given the command.\n\nThe environment inside the toad's stomach is a cavernous chamber, which includes a lake of strong corrosive \ngastric acid\n that can dissolve anything that should happen to fall into it, along with shores around the acid lake, and rock formations sticking out of the lake; the already-existing structures within the Toad's stomach are seemingly unaffected by the acid lake. Once trapped inside, an opponent is cut off from any allies and susceptible to attack, and can then be easily defeated.\n\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nSha no Sho\n, page 253"

The spring water produced by \nThe Hole\n appears to catalyse and speed up the recreation process because of the large \"life force\" flowing through it.\n[\n1\n]\n The downside to the accelerated rate at which the clone matures is that the snakes composing it have a very short lifespan, resulting in the clone splitting apart and dying after approximately 48 hours.\n[\n2\n]\n\n\nOnce the clone is created, Kabuto is able to gain control of it by placing a special talisman into its head. Depending on the talisman used, the clone can either become a mindless tool under Kabuto's control, with eyes possessing black sclera and white irides, or allowed to access their genetic source's personality and memories, while possessing eyes with dark grey sclera and white, snake-like irides. Clones produced through this method are also able to use any abilities possessed by their original selves, including those that they did not naturally acquire.\n[\n3\n]\n While not in battle, Kabuto stored the clones he created within large \nsnakes\n, which would burst out of the ground and release their contents when needed.\n\nKabuto first used this technique to create a clone of \nAkatsuki\n member \nHidan\n by placing snakes containing his DNA into the water produced by The Hole, causing them to quickly form into a humanoid shape, and then giving it life with a talisman. Later, snakes which had been ingested by \nNaruto Uzumaki\n created a \nclone\n of him upon exiting his body; a process which had greatly weakened him over the course of a day and ultimately paralysed him. Unlike the clone of Hidan, this clone did not require the insertion of a talisman to gain life and, due to the influence of \nKurama\n's \nchakra\n, was formed in Naruto's \nfour-tailed Version 2 state\n and possessed a strangely coloured body as well as a tail. The clone was also capable of resisting the control of Kabuto's talisman once it was inserted.\n[\n3\n]"

A unique trait of this technique is that it can momentarily give the user the appearance of death, fooling even the most talented \nmedical-nins\n.\n\nWhen combined with \nDark Chakra\n, this technique can also be used to physically enhance the person's speed, strength and healing capabilities to superhuman levels. It also alters the person's physical appearance drastically, making them younger and more fit in looks, greatly bulking their muscular physique. By Shinnō's claim, this form allows him to perform techniques that are normally taxing for the body, including open all \nEight Gates\n, without any drawbacks. However, if the user loses proper control over the dark chakra while performing this technique, it can cause severe backlash that can destroy the body."

The dragon itself is capable of flight, and, while Deidara is safely on its back, the dragon can spit out smaller clay figures that attack the opponent like guided missiles.\n\nThese independent missile-like creatures take the form of a greatly reduced version of the larger dragon that created them, however, despite this decrease in size they are still relatively larger than a normal person. Each is capable of tracking their intended target and producing a significant explosion proportional to size upon contact but as they emerge, they consume a substantial amount of clay from the original dragon, initially extracting it from the creature's tail. This ultimately limits the number that each C2 \"Dragon\" is capable of creating, before clay must be sacrificed from more vital areas, such as the body or wings. By using more clay, the missile's size and explosive power can be substantially increased.\n\nThe dragon can also produce clay mines at the expense of clay, that take the form of small spherical creatures, which can be subsequently manipulated to force opponents to fight in a limited space. This is achieved through the use of \nTobi\n's \nEarth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique\n, to hide a large amount of these mines underground, without the opponents' knowledge to their exact location.

His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of \nninshū\n, but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra. This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways. \n\n\n\nVariations\n[\n]\n\n\nCertain people, such as \nMinato Namikaze\n and \nNaruto Uzumaki\n could also mould the transferred chakra in order to adapt it to another person's specific chakra type.\n[\n1\n]\n In the latter's case, due to Kurama's chakra, it also enveloped the recipients in a chakra cloak similar to his \"Version 1\" form, albeit with no tails.\n[\n2\n]\n Once the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.\n\n\nKatsuyu\n and \nits\n \nsummoners\n have a unique bond between them through \nStrength of a Hundred Seal\n and they can use \nKatsuyu: Immense Network Healing\n.

By pointing his finger out at a target and writing the proper kanji in the air, this technique produces a variety of effects. \n\n\n\nKnown Words\n[\n]\n\n\nThe effects of these kanji have been shown:\n\n\n\n操, which comes from the verb 操る (\nayatsuru\n), meaning \"to manipulate\". This character allows Shiranami to manipulate and control his opponent. The effect manifests when Shiranami writes the kanji in the air at the target's direction; at which point, the kanji appears on the recipient's person. That individual then becomes a subject to Shiranami's will. However, as with the \nInfinite Embrace\n, it is not absolute, since a person with tremendous chakra can easily dispel the effect.\n\n\n滅, which comes from the verb 滅する (\nmessuru\n), meaning \"to destroy\". Shiranami uses this character to track down and destroy a message sent by carrier pigeon. \nUtakata\n destroyed the word before it could fulfil its purpose.\n\n\n岩 (\niwa\n, \nrock\n). This character allows Shiranami to immobilise targets. In the case of \nclones\n, this dispels them.\n\n\n爆 (\nbaku\n, \nexplode\n). This character causes several explosions that can also be used to dispel clones.\n\n\n火 (\nhi\n, \nfire\n). This character creates a blaze of fire, which can vary in size.\n\n\n炎 (\nen\n, \nflames\n). This character creates a large wall of fire to keep the enemies away.\n\n\n斬 (\nzan\n), which comes from the verb 斬る (\nkiru\n), meaning \"to kill with a blade\". This character creates several blades of wind.\n\n\n割 (\nkatsu\n, \nsplit\n). This character causes the ground underneath the target to split open.\n\n\nSee also\n[\n]\n\n\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing"

Sasuke ultimately chose to advance his seal to its second level, and went to Orochimaru with the help of the \nSound Four\n. \n\nWhen Sasuke activated the second level of the seal, his skin turned dark-grey and his hair grew and turned dark blue. His eyes also turned dark grey. Additionally, he grew webbed-claw-shaped wings from his back which he could use to fly and glide, and a dark, star-shaped mark appeared across the bridge of his nose. Should any limbs be lost, Sasuke is able to replace them with \nsnakes\n. During Sasuke's battle with \nItachi Uchiha\n, he lost the cursed seal, along with Orochimaru (having earlier been absorbed into Sasuke's body), as they were removed with the \nSword of Totsuka\n.\n\nAccording to \nKabuto\n, the seal itself contains Orochimaru's chakra, which Kabuto \nused\n in order to improve the binding power of \nSummoning: Impure World Reincarnation\n. In fact, when Orochimaru was defeated, his consciousness remained split amongst the cursed seals, and Sasuke used that, along with a piece of Kabuto's modified flesh, to bring the former back to his original state and mind.\n[\n2\n]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 199, pages 2-3\n\n\n\n\n↑ \nJump up to: \n2.0\n \n2.1\n \nNaruto\n chapter 593, page 9"

Behind their soul appears the Shinigami, which restrains their soul with its hair. Only the summoner is able to see the Shinigami at this point. After a few moments,\n[\n3\n]\n the Shinigami wraps its left arm with prayer beads and chants unintelligibly until a \ncursed seal\n appears on its arm. It then drives its arm into the summoner's soul, thus allowing the summoner to call upon the Shinigami to seal a target: the Shinigami's arm emerges from the summoner's body and grasps the target's soul.\n[\n1\n]\n When \nHiruzen Sarutobi\n performs it, he is required to get close to his target in order to initiate the seal.\n[\n3\n]\n When \nMinato Namikaze\n performs it, he is able to remain at a distance.\n[\n4\n]\n Targets are able to see the Shinigami so long as it's in contact with their soul.\n[\n5\n]\n\n\nWhile the Shinigami grabs their soul, the target is immobilised, any \njutsu\n they may be using are dispelled,\n[\n3\n]\n and they are prevented from performing additional jutsu.\n[\n5\n]\n With targets unable to escape or fight back, the summoner can remove and seal their soul. Hiruzen was able to seal multiple souls by using this technique in conjunction with the \nShadow Clone Technique\n.\n[\n3\n]\n The sealing, however, is not necessarily complete nor automatic:\n\n\n\nWhen Minato uses it, he seals only the \nNine-Tails\n' \nyin\n \nchakra\n, leaving its \nyang\n chakra alone.\n[\n6\n]\n\n\nWhen Hiruzen used it on \nOrochimaru\n, he had to rely on his own physical strength to extract Orochimaru's soul.\n[\n5\n]\n Because he lacked the strength to fully remove it,\n[\n7\n]\n he opted instead to only seal Orochimaru's arms, accomplished by having the Shinigami cut off the arms of Orochimaru's soul.\n[\n8\n]\n\n\nThe target's soul is sealed within the body of the summoner, represented by a swirl pattern on their torso that is similar in appearance to the \nEight Trigrams Sealing Style\n.\n[\n3\n]\n In Minato's case, this sealing of the Nine-Tails' yin chakra into himself makes him its \njinchūriki\n.\n[\n9\n]\n With the sealing completed, the Shinigami gradually starts consuming the summoner's soul.\n[\n8\n]\n The summoner can, with difficulty, continue moving and speaking, allowing them to finish any lingering business they may have, but they will die as soon as their soul has been fully consumed.\n[\n4\n]\n The souls of the summoner and their victim do not pass on to the \nPure Land\n,\n[\n10\n]\n instead being trapped within the Shinigami's stomach, destined to fight each other for all eternity.\n[\n5\n]\n\n\nAlthough Orochimaru survives the sealing of his arms, his arms are paralysed, causing them to hang uselessly at his sides. This prevents him from performing \nhand seals\n and by extension most \nninjutsu\n.\n[\n8\n]\n With time, he's able to regain limited use of the arms, but he's still left with a constant and extreme pain.\n[\n11\n]\n Orochimaru believes that \nTsunade\n could heal his arms - something Tsunade does not deny - but she refuses to help him.\n[\n12\n]\n Ultimately, after his arms begin to \nrot\n, Orochimaru is forced to \nswitch bodies\n or risk death.\n[\n13\n]\n He is able to make better use of the new body's arms,\n[\n14\n]\n but the jutsu he can use remain limited so long as his soul's arms are sealed within the Shinigami.\n[\n15\n]\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSouls being released from the Shinigami's stomach.\n \n \n\n\nSouls can only be freed from the Shinigami's stomach by using Dead Demon Consuming Seal: Release (\n屍鬼封尽・解\n, \nShiki Fūjin: Kai\n, \nEnglish TV:\n Reaper Death Seal: Release). To use, an individual wears the \nShinigami Mask\n, causing them to become possessed by the Shinigami. If the individual wearing the mask slices open their own stomach, the Shinigami will do the same, and any souls inside it will be freed. However, the mask doesn't have any properties that will prevent its user from dying of that injury; when Orochimaru uses this to restore his arms, he survives the injury by switching bodies once again. With the other souls he frees from the Shinigami, Orochimaru is able to use the \nImpure World Reincarnation\n.\n[\n15\n]"

    "jutsu_description": "When a person has been afflicted by a pathogen or toxin, this medical ninjutsu can be used to draw out the agent and heal the damage. The cause of the illness is first determined by perceiving disturbances in the patient's chakra. Then, using a \nchakra scalpel\n, an incision is made near the affected part. Using their chakra, the \nmedical-nin\n pushes a large volume of a medicinal fluid through the incision. The fluid then draws the poison out of the affected part(s) and serves as a medium through which the poison is suspended and then forced out of the person's body. This technique thus removes the poison, while simultaneously repairing the damage caused by the poison. The process itself is extremely painful and requires the subject to be restrained in order for the process to work. As such, it is considered a rather crude method to deal with pathogens and toxins, and only used in emergency. This technique only draws out most of the poison, not all of it, so the subject can potentially still be in danger, albeit not immediate. To fully treat the subject, an antidote is needed.\n\nAfter the agent is drawn out, it can be used to create an antidote or medicine after it has been analysed. This can then be given to the patient to ensure a complete recovery. This technique requires the utmost care and ability in diagnosis, incising and unmatched \nchakra control\n. Therefore, it is considered an extremely difficult technique, even among medical-nin."

Hearing also plays a major factor for the illusion to take effect; as hearing loss makes the target immune to the genjutsu entirely.

The chains move very fast, able to bypass \nGaara\n's \nShield of Sand\n, which is known for its speed. Once latched on to the target's body and \nchakra network\n, the chains will use the \ntenketsu\n located at the navel to reach their way to the \ntailed beast\n and constrict their neck, pulling the beast from the inside of the \njinchūriki\n. The continued forceful use of the tenketsu for the extraction damages the jinchūriki's chakra network contributing to the targeted jinchūriki's immobilisation and causing them pain. Others who attempt to touch the chains will be struck with a powerful electrical shock. However, if another jinchūriki touches the chains, then their chakra will be drained for the duration of the physical contact.\n\nThe technique can be countered. Techniques that suppress \nchakra absorption\n such as a \ncocoon\n made up of a network of highly refined chakra threads can slow down the rate at which the chakra is drained. The chakra absorption can be stopped completely by \nclosing\n the particular tenketsu the chains are using to extract the tailed beast.\n\nThere is a dangerous drawback to this technique, however. If the chains are removed before properly absorbing all the tailed beast chakra, they will turn on the nearest target with that chakra, with it being the caster, ultimately sealing them. Despite that, the seal can be broken if all tenketsu of the target are blocked, after which they will still be in need for immediate treatment."

In \nRock Lee\n's case, he also becomes extremely belligerent while drunk, thereby adding to his opponent's confusion because of how polite he usually is.\n[\n1\n]\n According to \nMight Guy\n, the Drunken Fist cannot be learned, taught, nor refined through training and practice.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\n\nLee is a natural prodigy of the Drunken Fist.\n[\n1\n]\n After drinking only a small amount of alcohol, his cheeks become red and he goes into a drunken rage, picking fights with friends and foes alike.\n[\n2\n]\n Since he's already very gifted with taijutsu, Lee is extremely destructive in his drunken state;\n[\n1\n]\n during his first drunk experience, he destroyed the restaurant where he was dining and even Guy struggled to subdue him.\n[\n2\n]\n Because of how easily Lee becomes drunk, he also sobers just as easily: when \nKimimaro\n only scratches his face,\n[\n3\n]\n Lee returns to normal shortly afterwards. Lee seems to have no memory of his actions while drunk, or at least he can't understand his hangover.\n[\n4\n]\n\n\nIn the anime, Lee developed a variant called \nSeasickness Fist\n, where he makes use of nausea caused by \nseasickness\n to overcome the fact he can't drink alcohol.\n[\n5\n]"

    "jutsu_description": "Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique\n is a \nKekkei Tōta\n utilised by the \nSecond\n and \nThird Tsuchikage\n.\n\n\n\nOverview\n[\n]\n\n\nThe user uses \nDust Release\n to create a structure, with a sphere located at its centre, between the palms of his hands. The structure expands rapidly in size when being propelled towards its intended target and traps them inside its confines. The sphere then seems to explode with a tremendous amount of force, while the exterior walls of the structure effectively restrict the size of the blast radius, resulting in the destruction of everything and anyone caught within as they are pulverised into minute particles of dust. Because it attacks at a molecular level, there is no conventional defence against this technique.\n[\n1\n]\n The technique isn't limited to just affecting physical matter; it can also affect \nchakra\n-based defences, witnessed from \nŌnoki\n's use of it to destroy \nMadara Uchiha\n's \nSusanoo\n.\n[\n2\n]\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nKakō's large variant.\n \n \n\n\nThe resulting damage that this technique can produce varies considerably, depending on the initial shape of the created structure. For example, when fabricated in the form of a cube, the structure possesses a relatively small blast radius, minimising the possibility for collateral damage. However, the conical version was implied to be enough to potentially destroy an \nentire island\n.\n[\n3\n]\n Additionally, it is possible to produce a much larger variant of the cube-shaped technique, which was large enough to destroy twenty-five Susanoo-clad \nwood clones\n in an instant. This cube can also be split into two after being activated, allowing for other techniques to be directed between the two halves.\n[\n4\n]\n When two similar techniques of approximately equal power collide, the pair merge into a single large spherical explosion; where everything caught within the substantial blast radius is completely pulverised.\n[\n5\n]\n\n\nKakō\n has shown he could fire off the cubical version of the technique one-handed, which allows him for a rapid-fire attack (albeit the cubes do not expand upon release).\n[\n6\n]\n\n\n\n\nShape Variants\n[\n]\n\n\nThis technique can be \nmanipulated\n into a diverse selection of three-dimensional structures, including cones, cylinders and cubes, with each retaining a sphere located at their centres. The size and length of it is proportional to the amount of chakra put into it. According to Ōnoki, the differences in shape demonstrated by the users of this technique is reflective of the generational gap between them.\n[\n5\n]\n\n\n\n\nCubical variant.\nDrill (\n錐\n, \nKiri\n)\n[\n7\n]\n variant.\nCylinder (\n柱\n, \nChū\n)\n[\n7\n]\n variant.\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑ \nJump up to: \n1.0\n \n1.1\n \nFourth Databook, page 259\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 575, pages 10-11\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 514, pages 1-2\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 588, pages 14-15\n\n\n\n\n↑ \nJump up to: \n5.0\n \n5.1\n \nNaruto\n chapter 546, pages 14-16\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nBoruto\n episode 87\n\n\n\n\n↑ \nJump up to: \n7.0\n \n7.1\n \nNaruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution"

    "jutsu_description": "This technique allows the user to create a protective wall out of \nearth\n. One method of doing this is for the user to convert \nchakra\n in their body into an earthen material that they spit from their mouth; the more skilled the user, the greater the volume of earth that can be created. The earth quickly piles up into a defensive wall, blocking incoming attacks. Although the muddy material is solid on its own, it is further fortified with a coat of chakra, making it more resistant to \nfire\n and \nwater\n than it would otherwise be.\n[\n1\n]\n\n\nA second method of performing this technique is to instead manipulate pre-existing earth directly: by placing their hands on the ground, users can raise the ground as a barrier in front of them.\n[\n3\n]\n Walls erected in this way are typically featureless, but users can alter the appearance if they choose; \nKakashi Hatake\n adorns his with \nbulldog\n sculptures. Users are not limited to strictly defensive uses for this technique, as they can create walls behind targets to prevent them from escaping\n[\n4\n]\n or even to entirely surround and encase said targets.\n[\n5\n]\n The anime shows users creating these walls from afar.\n[\n6\n]\n\n\nIn \nKakashi Retsuden\n, the Earth-Style Wall is one of several techniques that Kakashi specifically improves his ability with after the \nFourth Shinobi World War\n, to make up for the loss of his \nSharingan\n. His improved Earth-Style Wall is large enough to surround a small village, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannons, and he can remotely repair any damage it receives. Kakashi is able to maintain such a wall for over a day by himself, something most onlookers believe would require the work of team.\n[\n7\n]"

The translocation is easier and more accurate when used on objects within visual range, however for objects that are far away the process is more difficult, and if they have similar shapes he may be unable to discern which is which. For this reason he prepared a variety of metal objects with distinct shapes to act as unique symbols that he could visualize in order to accurately translocate to his intended coordinates even over great distances. Some of the objects he has marked include Sasuke's sword, his shuriken, his metal jewelry and pins, and several metal symbols carried by Koji's scout toads.\n[\n3\n]"

This part of the technique can be cured without the use of a release command, if they defeat their inner self that is in their head. \nHiruzen Sarutobi\n was troubled by the cruel effects of the Outer Path Seal, so he created a cure called the \"\nGedō Seal: Release\n\" (\n外道ノ印・解\n, \nGedō no In: Kai\n, \nliterally meaning:\n Outer Path Seal: Release) which can heal the effects of this technique from the target. Hiruzen Sarutobi then hid the scrolls containing the Outer Path Seal under the \nMemorial Stone\n, which he said is to be protected by heroes."

    "jutsu_description": "The \nGentle Fist\n (\n柔拳\n, \nJūken\n) is a form of hand-to-hand combat used by members of the \nHyūga clan\n. It inflicts internal damage through attacking the body's \nChakra Pathway System\n, subsequently injuring organs which are closely intertwined with the area of the network which has been struck. To do this, the user surgically injects a certain amount of their own \nchakra\n into the opponent's chakra pathway system, causing damage to surrounding organs due to their proximity to the chakra circulatory system. Even the slightest tap can cause severe internal damage, hence the name \"gentle\" fist.\n\nBy employing the use of the \nByakugan\n, an experienced user\n[\n1\n]\n can target the \ntenketsu\n, thus enhancing the havoc and control a Gentle Fist practitioner can impose upon an opponent's chakra network. These 361 nodes are key gate-keeping interceptions in the chakra circulatory network, thus forcibly opening or sealing them in whatever manner the Gentle Fist user sees fit, is a powerful tactical option to have. The affected person's chakra flow can either be increased or disrupted completely, preventing them from using techniques as seen in \nNeji\n's fight with \nHinata\n during the \nChūnin Exams\n, rendering her own Gentle Fist manoeuvres ineffective.\n\nNeji Hyūga noted that any chakra-based substance can be destroyed by this technique. As seen in his fight with \nKidōmaru\n, it is done by leaking chakra from the chakra openings in one's hands and moulding it into a needle-like shape to slice through the chakra.\n[\n2\n]\n In the novel, it was shown that one can even use the Gentle Fist to counter enemy technique, carefully cutting an attack two so that it passes by harmlessly.\n[\n3\n]\n In contrast, Kidōmaru managed to devise a \nmethod\n that prevented the chakra from being injected into the body, thus negating the main impact of the Gentle Fist through physical contact. Because Gentle Fist is mostly taijutsu, some believed users can only emit chakra from their hands due to the hands being the most mobile limbs on the body. However, users can emit chakra from any tenketsu, making binding them with chakra-based substance impossible.\n\nBeing a close-quarter combat style, Gentle Fist practitioners have a disadvantage against long-range fighters, as Kidōmaru took full advantage of his distance weaponry to overwhelm Neji.\n\nBecause the chakra pathway system is invisible to the naked eye, the Byakugan is required for most techniques of this style. Since the Byakugan is unique to the Hyūga clan, it has become their \nsignature style\n of combat. The ability to inflict severe internal trauma with minimal external force, combined with chakra network manipulation, makes the Gentle Fist the most reputable and fearsome taijutsu style known in all of \nKonohagakure\n.\n[\n4\n]\n In contrast to this, the technique can also be used for supplementary purposes displayed when \nHinata\n used the technique to fix \nNaruto Uzumaki\n's dislocated shoulder joint during the \nFourth Shinobi World War\n.\n[\n5\n]\n\n\nDue to their possession of the Byakugan, the \nŌtsutsuki clan\n also practices this taijutsu form, though far more aggressive than what the Hyūga clan practices. \nMomoshiki Ōtsutsuki\n demonstrated his while fighting Naruto Uzumaki, targeting Naruto's tenketsu and internal organs to try to incapacitate him.\n[\n6\n]"

The seal itself acts as a gateway to a \nseparate dimension\n that Tanuki called the underworld (\n異界\n, \nikai\n), wherein dwells a legendary beast named \nNue\n that is born the moment the seal is completed.\n[\n2\n]\n\n\nThe mark acts as a medium for \nabsorbed chakra\n to be transferred into the Nue, nourishing it, as well as a gate through which it can be summoned. It also allows the user to create snake-like creatures out of dark \nchakra\n, which can be used in battle or parasitically attached to individuals suffering from negative emotions to continually drain their chakra, further disturbing their mental state. As Nue is fed chakra, the seal's pattern spreads and the beast quickly grows into a gigantic monster, eventually becoming a living chakra bomb that can be summoned to a location and detonated, creating an explosion large enough to destroy an entire city.\n\nThe principal usage of the Gozu Tennō is to send the host into enemy territory to release Nue, who will rampage as much as possible before detonating to wipe out everything, including the host.\n\nAs the true source of power for this technique is negative emotions, if the vessel overcomes these emotions the seal will be destroyed.

A large, complicated technique formula is drawn around them, focused around the injury to be healed.\n[\n2\n]\n A sample of the patient's cells, such as a lock of their hair, is placed near the injury, to be used as a medium for the procedure. Medics take position around the formula's perimeter, notably the corners, and work together to change the medium's cellular makeup, converting it into whatever cells are required for mending the wound. This is where the technique's greatest difficulty lies, as medics must be careful to form the correct cell and then just as carefully apply it to the regenerating injury.\n[\n1\n]\n\n\nIn the anime, \nSakura Haruno\n is shown using this technique by herself; she needs neither the large formula nor the medium.

The user produces the \"sit\" (\n座\n, \nza\n) kanji in their palm, and by touching the tailed beast, or its \njinchūriki\n with their hand, the user can suppress the chakra inside an area which is usually lined with ten pillars.\n[\n3\n]\n\n\nWhen Yamato used this technique to suppress \nNaruto Uzumaki\n's \nfour-tailed form\n, Naruto needed to be in possession of the \nFirst Hokage's Necklace\n to aid in suppressing the \nNine-Tails\n' chakra.\n\nWhen \nHashirama\n used it on a tailed beast directly rather than a jinchūriki, he circumvented the use of the pillars and channelled the \ntailed beast control\n through his \nWood Release: Wood Human Technique\n, which could even overwrite the control of a tailed beast \ncontrolled\n by the \nSharingan\n.\n[\n4\n]\n\n\n\n\nInfluence\n[\n]\n\n\n\"Jijun\" (\n耳順\n) is a Japanese term used for people in their sixties.

The pictures and poems are intended to illustrate the stages of Zen discipline.\n\nThey were drawn by a twelfth-century Chinese Zen master called Kuòān (\n廓庵\n, \nJapanese: Kakuan\n).

Users can take advantage of the surrounding environment to launch themselves into the air,\n[\n1\n]\n increasing the damage when they fall back to the ground. The speed at which they spin has the added benefit of rendering most attacks ineffective against them.\n[\n2\n]\n But the ball's speed also makes it difficult to turn, forcing users to stop spinning entirely if they want to make significant changes in direction and thus leaving them vulnerable while they do.\n[\n3\n]\n\n\nHow the Human Bullet Tank is used depends on what form the Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique takes. In Part I, when \nChōji Akimichi\n's Multi-Size Technique makes him very round, he retracts his arms, legs, and head into his body so that they don't get in the way while he rolls; because his head is submerged in his bulk, this also makes him immune to external sounds.\n[\n3\n]\n In Part II, when Chōji's Multi-Size Technique simply makes him large, he folds his legs to his chest and locks his arms around them.\n[\n4\n]"

Inner Sakura has the habit of saying \"\nShānnarō\n!\" (\nしゃーんなろー\n). The phrase has no literal meaning, but is usually translated as \"Hell yeah!\", \"Hell no!\", or \"Damn it!\", depending on the situation. The English anime translates it as a forceful \"Cha!\" Inner Sakura is unique as it is in a way a second will within Sakura's mind.\n\nAlthough she appeared quite frequently at the start of the series, Inner Sakura all but disappeared midway through Part I, and rarely appears in Part II. The reason behind this is that she no longer needs to hide her true feelings or reactions behind a fake smile, finally allowing herself to truly say what is on her mind. However, because Inner Sakura usually possessed somewhat violent reactions to things, Sakura is now prone to violent outbursts, which is not helped by her chakra-enhanced strength, making her very scary if one upsets her, similar to her teacher \nTsunade\n.\n\n\n\nUsage\n[\n]\n\n\nDuring the Chūnin Exams, Inner Sakura was strong enough to repel \nIno\n from Sakura's body when she used the \nMind Body Switch Technique\n on her. In many video games, Inner Sakura was made into a technique for Sakura due to her lack of techniques of her own early self in the series. In most appearances, Inner Sakura is a \ntaijutsu\n where Sakura's inner feelings burst out and she unleashes all her strength on the target with one or more punches. However, Inner Sakura may also interact with Sakura or the opponent(s) as a \nclone\n or \ngenjutsu\n, as shown with the \nClone Combo\n, \nThe Great Sakura\n, and the \nTwinkling Maiden's Heart\n."

Deidara stole this technique in his quest to find the ultimate art and used it in conjunction with his \nExplosion Release\n \nkekkei genkai\n to infuse explosive chakra into clay, creating his signature \nExplosive Clay\n. Sekiei, a \nfabrication\n, was given both the \nnature transformation\n and this technique to utilise it in the same way."

According to Itachi, this technique and Izanagi form a pair, but unlike the latter, which is a technique capable of altering destiny, Izanami is instead one that \"\ndecides\n\" it.\n[\n4\n]\n\n\n\n\nActivation Requirement\n[\n]\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe mechanics behind the technique.\n \n \n\n\nTo begin the technique, after selecting any arbitrary moment, the caster uses their Sharingan to remember the physical sensations both of their body and that of their opponent's during that instant like a photograph (represented as: \nA\n). The user must then intentionally replicate the same sensation and in the same way, memorise that instant with their Sharingan (represented as: \nA'\n). Izanami overlaps and connects these two identical bodily sensations (A and A'), as well as the flow of time between them, creating an infinite loop of events that entraps the opponent's consciousness. The user can also use their Sharingan to remember multiple sensations, (represented as B, C, and so forth) and those sensations will also be used when Izanami is activated. The user also doesn't need necessarily to replicate A with A' to initiate Izanami. They can also replicate B with B' or C with C' as well. The more sensations they memorise, the better their chances would be to initiate Izanami on a person and the more sensations the victim will experience each time they repeat a loop.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\n\n\n\n\nEffects\n[\n]\n\n\nWhilst under the effects of the technique, the target stands motionlessly as the loop of events continually replays inside their mind.\n[\n7\n]\n Each time a loop is repeated, any physical damage incurred is reset as it were before the start of the loop, although the remains of severed appendages do not disappear.\n[\n8\n]\n The illusion of the user and anyone they were fighting alongside also have any damage reset as well such as the blindness that comes with Izanami. Despite being able to become consciously aware of their situation and act differently, the victim is unable to significantly alter or escape from the inevitable progression of these events as the illusions they're fighting will also quickly adapt to their changes in order to force the victim to experience the memorised sensations. However, because this technique was created to reprimand and save the users of Izanagi, the victim is able to escape the infinite loop if they can acknowledge the real results of their actions and in doing so, accept their fate.\n[\n9\n]\n In the anime, it's shown that there is no other way to undo this technique even by someone who has complete control over their chakra. The illusion of the caster also seems to be sentient as the illusionary Itachi was shown to be shaking his head when Kabuto futilely tried to undo the technique without accepting his fate first.\n[\n10\n]\n The illusion of the user and anyone they're fighting alongside also repeats their verbal actions such as the illusionary Itachi telling the illusionary Sasuke not to leave his side, an action Itachi did to Sasuke. The illusion of the user will continuously tell the victim to take a closer look at them and acknowledge their mistakes until they do so.\n\n\n\nCreation\n[\n]\n\n\nAccording to Itachi, there was a point in time where members of the clan abused the abilities granted by Izanagi, instead simply casting the technique as a means of escaping the undesirable results of their actions. Whilst this resulted in little issue if only one person were using Izanagi, if there were two or more casters, they would begin to fight amongst each other over personally favourable outcomes. Thus, as dōjutsu users were unlikely to succumb to ocular genjutsu, Izanami was created as a method to reprimand such clansmen, as well as save them from their own arrogance. By imprisoning them within an unalterable loop of events, the victim was forced to accept the reality they had created if they ever wished to escape the illusion. However, because of the dangers involved in using a technique with a built-in escape route in a real battle, Izanami became classed as a \nkinjutsu\n.\n[\n11\n]\n As such, Izanami is ironically not a genjutsu to be used on an enemy, but on a friend who has lost their way as a means of helping them find themselves again.\n\n\n\nInfluence\n[\n]\n\n\nLike the various techniques used with the Sharingan, this technique is named after a \nShintō\n \ngoddess\n. In this case, it is \nIzanami\n, who, together with her brother and husband \nIzanagi\n, created the islands and other deities of Japan.\n\nOne of the most famous stories about Izanami tells the tale of how Izanagi goes into \nYomi\n, the Japanese underworld, to retrieve her after she died giving birth to the Shintō fire god, \nKagutsuchi\n. In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape. Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form. Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave. Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day. In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day. In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\n\nAfter his failed attempt to get Izanami, Izanagi washed himself in a stream. As he cleaned his left eye, \nAmaterasu\n was born, as he cleaned his right eye, \nTsukuyomi\n was born, and as he cleaned his nose, \nSusanoo\n was born.\n\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nFourth Databook, page 232\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 581, page 15\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 587, page 1\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 581, pages 15-17\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 587, page 2-5\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto: Shippūden\n episode 338\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 586, pages 14-17\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 586, page 18\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 587, page 6\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto: Shippūden\n episode 337\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 587, pages 3-6"

Over time, the Kāma will gradually overwrite the vessel's genetic profile until they transform into a perfect Ōtsutsuki. Should the Ōtsutsuki be slain, their \nsoul\n will migrate to one of their vessels and become anchored to the world of the living, and when the Kāma completes, will reincarnate (\n転生\n, \ntensei\n) through their body, completely replacing them.\n\nIn the interim, the vessel can learn to activate the Kāma and utilise a portion of the Ōtsutsuki's power and abilities, and if reincarnation has not yet been achieved, the soul of the slain Ōtsutsuki can even manifest and temporarily take control over their body.\n\nCompatibility with an Ōtsutsuki is exceedingly rare and unpredictable, and if an individual is not a suitable recipient, the ritual will typically result in them suffering a fatal seizure. Occasionally, an unsuitable vessel will survive the ritual, however, producing a unique variant of the seal called the \nWhite Kāma\n (\n白き楔\n, \nShiroki Kāma\n). Such individuals are unable to serve as a receptacle for the Ōtsutsuki's soul and thus cannot be used for the process of reincarnation, nor can use its absorption power nor \nspace-time ninjutsu\n, but retain its other traits, gaining tremendous power and even being able to transform into a completely new Ōtsutsuki.

Ōga can use the genjutsu anyway she sees fit, creating multiple rooms and landscapes, even those that exist in the real world, such as \nKara's hideout\n, with traps and hazards. She can operate as two individuals within the genjutsu; as an older man who guides them through the experiments she had conceived and as a kunoichi named Yatsume that is also one of the subjects to further study the others. \n\nThose who die within the genjutsu do not die in the real world, but they remain stasis in tanks until the genjutsu ends. There are two ways of ending the genjutsu: the captives must kill Ōga within it or the Illusion scroll that is keeping the genjutsu active must be removed. Should the former be chosen, Ōga would become comatose in the real world. \n\n\n\nExperiments\n[\n]\n\n\nŌga had gathered twenty-one subjects for her experiments. The following various genjutsu experiments test the subjects ability to survive. \n\n\n\nNine Lives\n\n\nBefore the first experiment, Ōga provided a test for any one of the subjects to participate. She had ten cards, nine are \"death\" while one was \"life\", and if the participant picks the \"life\" card, they live. A \nKirigakure\n shinobi participated in this test, randomly picking a \"death\" card which resulted in him being killed by Ōga.\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\nFor the first experiment, Ōga placed the now twenty subjects on a crumbling platform in the middle of an abyss. The subjects are to reach a higher platform in order to survive. With the help of Kiseru, those who were not shinobi were able to reach it with ladders placed on the top.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubjects\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n\nAnaguma\n\n\nDropped to his death by Rokuro\n\n\n\n\n\nBatta\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nFugō\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nKakesu\n\n\nDropped to her death\n\n\n\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nNamua\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nRokuro\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nShamo\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed \nKusagakure\n shinobi\n\n\nProceeded; killed by Rokuro in the intermission for being an undercover Outer\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 1\n\n\nDropped to her death\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 2\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 3\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 4\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 1\n\n\nDropped to his death\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 2\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 3\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 4\n\n\nDropped to his death\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 5\n\n\nDropped to his death\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\nYatsume\n\"\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nLight\n\n\nIn the second experiment, Ōga warped the remaining subjects in a dark room with candles. The objective is to keep the candles from going out before they reach the goal, otherwise the one whose candle is extinguished will die, with their life force connected to it. The subjects must traverse into a desert with an active sandstorm, which makes it difficult to keep the candles from going out. To extend the flame and prevent their candles from melting, Boruto, Shamo, \"Yatsume\", Kiseru and Namua combined theirs, keeping them all alive. However, Rokuro, Batta and Fūgo, who instructed the latter, claimed theirs from the remaining subjects, stocking up their candles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubjects\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n\nBatta\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nFugō\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nNamua\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nRokuro\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nShamo\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 2\n\n\nKilled by Batta\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 3\n\n\nCandle extinguished by Rokuro\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 4\n\n\nCandle extinguished\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 2\n\n\nCandle extinguished\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 3\n\n\nKilled by Batta\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\nYatsume\n\"\n\n\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\nPressure\n\n\nIn the third experiment, the subjects are sent to an empty room.

The objective is to find hidden hiding spots for the subjects to hide in to avoid being crushed. However, there is only one concealed spot for the subjects to hide in that is only room for one. Fugō claimed this spot, while Boruto and Batta located a weak point in the room's floor to expose in order for the subjects to hide.

Contained within the envelopes are numbers ranging from 1 to 8. The objective is to fight the subjects for their cards in order to have a passing score of 7 or more. Whoever possesses a 7 from the start simply needs to reach the goal without being targeted by others.

The goal was to supposedly escape Ōga's lair, which appeared reminiscent to Kara's hideout in the real world. \"Yatsume\" obtained a map and key card from the Kusa Outer that Rokuro killed in the previous genjutsu to help the remaining three navigate the labyrinth. There were also traps within the labyrinth, even puppets of Ōga's male persona. \n\nWhen Boruto and \"Yatsume\" went further, the latter dropped her disguise and revealed herself as the real Ōga. Impressed with Boruto navigating through all her experiments, Ōga provided the means to end the genjutsu by killing her and removing the Illusion scroll in the real world that kept the genjutsu active for the other subjects. With being given a reason to live by Boruto, they broke out of the genjutsu together and Ōga ended the genjutsu herself for the rest of the subjects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubjects\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\n\n\nEscaped the genjutsu\n\n\n\n\n\nRokuro\n\n\nKilled by Ōga puppet\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\nYatsume\n\"\n\n\nRevealed to be Ōga; woken by Boruto in the real world and ended the genjutsu\n\n\n\nSee Also\n[\n]\n\n\nGenjutsu Communication\n\n\nEngraved Tsukuyomi\n\n\nInfinite Tsukuyomi"

    "jutsu_description": "This is the ultimate \ntaijutsu\n technique created by the legendary taijutsu master \nChen\n. It appears to be initiated by an upward spin kick at which point it quickly becomes a tornado. Forming into a dragon with long whiskers, it attacks the target aiming to swallow them, at which point they are cut by the razor sharp winds inside the attack. After initiating the attack, the user appears to remain shielded within the base of the tornado as the outward surface of the dragon seems to be solid enough for a person to impact and rebound off of, making the only way to enter the technique once it has been initiated is by being swallowed.\n\nHowever, there is one distinct weakness to the technique. Since the Dragon God's true form is that of an ordinary tornado, its attack power is based on rotation. If one enters the attack's centre (Dragon's Eye) while rotating at high speed, such as \nLee\n's \nOne-Man Front Lotus\n, it can be dispersed without inflicting damage.\n\n\n\nSee Also\n[\n]\n\n\nDaytime Tiger\n\n\nEvening Elephant\n\n\nNight Guy\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto: Ultimate Ninja Online"

    "jutsu_description": "The \nLiving Corpse Reincarnation\n is a technique that was developed by \nOrochimaru\n that allows him to transfer his \nsoul\n to someone else's body. It is also referred to as the \"Eternal Youth and Immortality Technique\". It was developed in order to fuel his dream of acquiring all the knowledge in existence, a feat that cannot be achieved in a single lifetime.\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\n\n1\n \nUsage\n\n\n2\n \nKnown Hosts or Candidates\n\n\n\n\n2.1\n \nHosts\n\n\n2.2\n \nCandidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n \nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n[\n]\n\n\nThe Living Corpse Reincarnation immortalises one's mind, transferring it to a stronger body before the current host rots. By repeating this process periodically, this effectively allows the user to remain in the realm of living, so long as they can keep the host body alive while residing within.\n\nOrochimaru can only perform this technique once every three years. It also seems that when the three years are almost over, he is forced to move into another host, as the previous one begins to weaken and reject him. Presumably, if he had a proper container, he could stay in the host for a full lifetime. The fact that he wanted to prepare \nSasuke Uchiha\n and \nKimimaro\n for the transfer before performing it reinforces this.\n\nTo perform this technique, Orochimaru reveals his \ntrue form\n: a gigantic white snake composed of smaller white snakes, by abandoning his current host's body. Orochimaru then swallows the new host and takes him or her to a separate, mental plane where he envelops the mind of his victim. The snake body then dies and falls apart, and Orochimaru's soul dominates the body (though the \nSharingan\n seems to be able to reverse the process against Orochimaru, which also grants the host Orochimaru's supply of chakra and powers). The souls of the hosts are kept alive within Orochimaru, leaving them \"still alive\", in a sense (albeit suppressed), and when Orochimaru switches hosts, the souls leave with him. Apparently if the host of these souls' chakra level falls enough it is possible for them to resurface in material form as seen with Orochimaru surfacing with his \nEight Branches Technique\n after Sasuke used up most of his chakra.\n\nAfter taking over another body, Orochimaru modifies it to suit his theme of snakes, in order to increase his survival capabilities, such as \nstretching and bending his body\n, \nreconnecting any severed parts\n, and \nshedding his skin to heal injuries\n. This ensures that if Orochimaru cannot transfer to another body within the three years' time, he can allow his current one to greatly heal and evade attacks, rendering it virtually immortal; Sasuke refers this as the \"\nPower of the White Snake\n\" (\n白蛇の力\n, \nShirohebi no Chikara\n).\n[\n2\n]\n Orochimaru also \nalters the face\n of his host to look like his original form.\n\nAfter being revived through the \nEvil Releasing Method\n, Orochimaru seemingly circumvented this process, emerging in a slightly different snake form and then slithering into a \nWhite Zetsu\n clone's mouth.\n[\n3\n]\n\n\n\n\nKnown Hosts or Candidates\n[\n]\n\n\nHosts\n[\n]\n\n\nUnknown person — when Orochimaru uses his Living Corpse Reincarnation on Sasuke, one of his past hosts is seen in Orochimaru and Sasuke's mental plane.\n\n\nUnknown person — when Orochimaru uses his Living Corpse Reincarnation on Sasuke, another one of his past hosts is seen in Orochimaru and Sasuke's mental plane.\n\n\nUnknown female — for replacing the hand Itachi Uchiha severed; left body to escape the effects of his arms being \nsealed away\n.\n\n\nGen'yūmaru\n — a desperate temporary replacement body before Sasuke Uchiha; left body for Sasuke Uchiha.\n\n\nSasuke Uchiha\n — after having been absorbed by Sasuke when he reversed his Living Corpse Reincarnation technique, took over due to Itachi's battle with his brother lowering Sasuke's chakra enough for Orochimaru to gain control; was \nsealed away\n by Itachi.\n\n\nWhite Zetsu Clone\n — for the \ncells\n of \nHashirama Senju\n, as well as to escape the fatal injury of \nreleasing\n the \nDead Demon Consuming Seal\n.\n[\n3\n]\n\n\nCandidates\n[\n]\n\n\nItachi Uchiha\n — for the \nSharingan\n; failed due to Orochimaru being unable to defeat him.\n\n\nKimimaro\n — for the \nShikotsumyaku\n; rejected due to terminal disease.\n\n\nGuren\n — for the \nCrystal Release\n; rejected due to being too late and loss of interest.\n(anime only)\n\n\nSasuke Uchiha\n — for the \nSharingan\n; postponed due to being overpowered by Sasuke, then sealed away before another of his consciousnesses was released by the \nEvil Releasing Method\n.\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nTō no Sho\n, page 270\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 365, page 8\n\n\n\n\n↑ \nJump up to: \n3.0\n \n3.1\n \nNaruto\n chapter 618, page 15"

Once mastered, users can strike targets from far greater distances than they could if simply throwing a kunai. Any metallic object can be fired in this way assuming the current of lightning is large enough: a ship's anchor caught in such a field will shoot into the sky, the rest of the ship being dragged through the air behind it.\n\nWhen \nSarada Uchiha\n and \nMitsuki\n are learning to use the Lorentz Gun, they encounter three different hurdles: getting their thrown kunai into the electric field at all, keeping the field active long enough for the kunai to reach its destination, and furthermore accurately designating the target they want the kunai to hit. Their teacher, \nSasuke Uchiha\n, can do all of these things instinctively and doesn't have enough experience with teaching to articulate how he does any of these things.

With each attack they receive, the figures multiply.\n[\n1\n]\n\n\nBecause this is only a \ngenjutsu\n, the black figures cannot do any actual harm to their targets. However, if users - while hiding nearby - coordinate their attacks with the figures', such as by secretly throwing \nkunai\n along the same trajectory, targets may not realise the kunai are real and thus won't know to dodge until it's too late. Even if targets can avoid damage, being subjected to this sort of tactic for prolonged periods will inevitably wear them down, making them easy to finish off.\n[\n2\n]\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n[\n]\n\n\nHaze Clone Technique\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑ \nJump up to: \n1.0\n \n1.1\n \nRin no Sho\n, page 172\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 62"

For information on the character, see \nNaraka Path\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nNaraka Path\n (\n地獄道\n, \nJigokudō\n) grants the user two main abilities: interrogation and restoration, by using the \nKing of Hell\n.\n \nPain\n channelled the power of the Naraka Path through the body of a \npriest\n.\n\nThe Naraka Path ability makes heavy use of the King of Hell. The King of Hell is a large head which sprouts out of the ground surrounded by purple flames. It also possesses the Rinnegan as well as the shared field of vision along with the other summons.\n[\n2\n]\n\n\nTo interrogate, the Naraka Path need only catch hold of a person, causing the King of Hell to appear before them. With the victim seemingly paralysed, the Naraka Path begins questioning them. After answers are given, the \nKing of Hell\n will unzip its mouth to release tendril-like arms and would draw out an apparition of the victim's life force energy in the form of an enlarged tongue. The King of Hell would then proceed to pass its judgement. If the person was lying or refused to answer the questions, the King of Hell would remove their tongue and consume it, apparently killing them. However, if they told the truth, they would be spared, although left extremely exhausted. \n\nThe second ability the Naraka Path possessed is the ability to repair any damage. To do so the Naraka Path has the King of Hell ingest the damaged body with its tendril-like arms into its mouth, then, after some time, the destroyed body will emerge from its mouth, completely rejuvenated. It did this for example to the \nAsura Path\n after it was destroyed by \nChōji\n and \nChōza Akimichi\n. With its restorative abilities, the Naraka Path can easily be regarded as the most valuable body if the Six Paths of Pain is being used through six different bodies. During formation, Nagato puts the Naraka Path at the rear behind the sentimental Deva Path with the other four taking the front lines. \n\nKabuto Yakushi\n stated that a Naraka Path user can transport bodies and souls using the King of Hell.\n[\n3\n]\n\n\n\n\nInfluences\n[\n]\n\n\nNaraka\n (Sanskrit: नरक) is the Sanskrit word for the underworld. In Hinduism it is a place where souls are sent for the expiation of their sins. Yama is the Lord of Justice and the King of Hell. He assigns appropriate punishments to living beings after death. For example, he might immerse them in boiling oil. If you lie to him, he will rip out your tongue.\n\n\nIn Buddhism, the Naraka realm, or \"hell realm\", is a plane of rebirth, based on Karma (actions of body, speech, and mind) built up in a previous life or lives. There are various Naraka, each containing beings that are tormented until their Karma has achieved its full and satisfactory results. The beings can then be reborn into a higher plane.\n\n\nThe Naraka are superficially similar to the Christian hell or purgatory, although there are many significant differences.\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nFourth Databook, page 254\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 422, page 4\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 551, page 8"

This will cause a water dragon to rise from the ground and envelop Gaara, soaking his sand and making it become much heavier. This causes it to clump and makes it near impossible to utilise."

For information on the character, see \nPreta Path\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nPreta Path\n (\n餓鬼道\n, \nGakidō\n) grants the user the ability to absorb chakra in any form.\n Pain channelled the Preta Path through the corpse of a \nKusagakure\n \nshinobi\n.\n\nThis ability is primarily defensive in nature as it is capable of absorbing chakra from an individual through physical contact. In addition to this, the Preta Path is able to absorb ninjutsu-based techniques that are pure chakra or chakra based, thereby nullifying their effect. It doesn't absorb physical attacks, like Gaara's sand, but does drain the sand's chakra.\n[\n1\n]\n This is done by forming a \nbarrier\n around the user's entire body, allowing them to absorb attacks from all directions.\n\nAlthough the ability is able to absorb \nsenjutsu\n chakra, the user is still vulnerable to the effects of turning into a stone statue from absorbing too much of it.\n\nDuring the \nFourth Shinobi World War\n, Nagato used the Preta Path to absorb \nKiller B\n's chakra while he was in his Version 2 form. He then apparently used the chakra to revitalise his body to its state before it was emaciated by the \nDemonic Statue of the Outer Path\n. It also restored his hair colour back from white to red, as well as the damage done to his legs. However, presumably due to loss of \nmuscle memory\n, he was not able to use the legs completely.\n[\n2\n]\n\n\nThis ability can be nullified if an opponent uses \nspecific\n \ntechniques\n that can either \nsuppress\n the user’s movements or their chakra.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n\n\n\n\nInfluences\n[\n]\n\n\nIn Buddhism, the Preta realm (also known as the Hungry Ghost realm) is a reincarnation based on strong possessiveness and desire which were cultivated in a previous life or lives. The Preta are humanoid creatures which are perpetually hungry and thirsty, but are unable to satisfy themselves, living lives similar to those of hopeless addicts trying to appease their unyielding hunger. In appearance, the Preta are deathly pale, emaciated figures, which contrasts with Pain's Preta Path's hefty stature. In Hinduism Preta could also mean ghosts this also relates to the technique the Preta path uses. \n\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 560, page 14\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 550, pages 17-18\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 588, pages 15-16\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 656, page 2"

From the scroll, more than a hundred \npuppets\n wearing red cloaks emerge.\n\nAs even the most elite of puppeteers cannot control more than ten puppets a time (one per finger), this technique is proof of Sasori's superiority with regard to the \nPuppet Technique\n. Also, normally a puppet's movement is dependent on the will of the user, and as such there will be a time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response. However, since these hundred puppets are directly connected to Sasori's core, there is no time lag between Sasori's will and the puppets' movements.\n\nSasori stated that he brought down an entire country (the \nLand of This\n in the anime) with this technique. Many of the puppets, however, were destroyed during Sasori's battle with \nChiyo\n and \nSakura Haruno\n, although they did manage to destroy some of Chiyo's \nWhite Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets\n. While these one hundred puppets lacked teamwork, they apparently used sheer attrition and numbers to overwhelm their opponents. Even when they decrease in numbers they do not become less dangerous as it merely allows Sasori to focus more on the remaining puppets. \n\nAs with all of Sasori's puppets, all the weapons wielded are coated in his special \npoison\n, which would kill the victims after three days of painful paralysis.\n\nIn the anime, Sasori was shown using this technique while inside \nHiruko\n.\n[\n2\n]"

    "jutsu_name": "Redaku Reincarnation Ninjutsu",
    "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, Reincarnation Ninjutsu",
    "jutsu_description": "This \nreincarnation ninjutsu\n is one of the many subjects documented at the centuries-old \nAstronomy Research Institute\n, an archive of knowledge for the \nLand of Redaku\n. A few years prior to the events of \nSasuke Retsuden\n, \nZansūru\n, an archaeologist, deciphered enough of the relevant research to learn how to use this technique. However, because he was not a \nninja\n, he recruited \nJiji\n to perform it on his behalf. A few decades prior to this, \nOrochimaru\n visited the Institute to research this technique, ultimately stealing a few of the more valuable documents for his own purposes and using what he learned to improve upon \nTobirama Senju\n's \nImpure World Reincarnation\n.\n\n\n\nOverview\n[\n]\n\n\nThis technique is similar to the Impure World Reincarnation in many ways, to the point that \nSasuke Uchiha\n initially believes they are the same. Zansūru insists that the Impure World Reincarnation is merely a regional variant. Like the Impure World Reincarnation, this technique brings back souls of the dead using living sacrifices; Jiji exclusively reincarnates \ndinosaurs\n (more commonly called \"dragons\"), but also planned to reincarnate a human, \nMargo\n, until he found out that she wasn't actually dead. Jiji summons a dinosaur's soul using its fossilised remains and places its soul in the body of the live sacrifice: a \nchicken\n, one of the closest extant relatives of dinosaurs. Dust and ash encase the chicken's body, giving it the same size and appearance as the dinosaur had in life.\n\nThe dinosaur's reincarnated body retains all the physical skills it had when it was alive. In \nthe novel\n, it also has the added advantage of being immortal; it can be damaged, but its body will repair itself indefinitely regardless of severity. Not all wounds heal at the same speed, with burns being observed to still linger after several days. Unlike the humans reincarnated with the Impure World Reincarnation, who don't seem fazed by injuries, the dinosaurs reincarnated with this technique still feel pain. Yet because they can't die, they must suffer through any injuries that would ordinarily kill them until their body is healed. This detail draws empathy from Sasuke, prompting him to avoid injuring the dinosaurs when possible: he believes \nAmaterasu\n could be used to \"kill\" the dinosaurs, burning them with undying flames and rendering them incapacitated, but decides not to try it so as not to subject them to the prolonged pain that would cause. However in the \nanime adaptation\n this jutsu lacks most of the immortality advantages. The reincarnated beings bleed and can be killed with a serious enough damage.\n\nHow the user controls the reincarnated is never made clear, only that there are no talismans placed in the skulls as is done with the Impure World Reincarnation. The user's control over those they reincarnate is great enough that it can't be overcome with standard \ngenjutsu\n. Sasuke is able to somewhat erode the control over one dinosaur, \nMenō\n, by speaking to him kindly, refusing to harm him, and by offering to return him to the afterlife, something that Menō wants. This momentarily allows him to establish control over Menō with a genjutsu, which he then makes permanent by channelling his \nchakra\n into Menō's body to overwrite Jiji's control.\n\nHaving control of a reincarnated form grants certain advantages. Information gathered by the reincarnated can be instantly passed along to their controller, such as to help the controller locate somebody they're searching for. Conversely, the controller can pass some of their chakra to the reincarnated, enhancing their strength: Menō, a juvenile of his species, is able to overpower an adult of the same species because he has access to Sasuke's chakra. Control of one or more reincarnated subjects can be granted to non-users - as Jiji does to Zansūru - but these non-users cannot give commands that are too complicated. Furthermore, new commands will immediately override previous commands regardless of potential consequences; Zansūru at one point commands a flying dinosaur to let him ride it, but later gives the same dinosaur a new command unrelated to being ridden, causing Zansūru to fall off and die upon impact with the ground. If and when the non-user dies, any commands they gave are rescinded and the original user's most recent commands take effect again.\n\nTo release this technique, the user performs the same hand seals that are used to initiate it in the first place, thus freeing the souls (even those under the control of another) from their reincarnated bodies. The souls do not immediately return to the afterlife, instead lingering in their bodies for a few moments; this brief delay gives Sasuke and Menō a chance to exchange farewells. One dinosaur is even shown clinging to its reincarnated body, using the brief window of no longer being controlled to attack Jiji, vengeance for having brought it back to the living world. Once the souls do finally depart, their body disintegrates back into the dust and ash that they were made of."

Thus, the technique both briefly inhibits the opponent's senses, as well as techniques that require their active concentration.\n\nAccording to \nKabuto\n, only he is capable of functioning normally whilst this technique is in effect, thanks to the properties of his \nSage Mode\n and his adopted abilities. Due to his \nsnake\n characteristics, Kabuto can close the \ncornea\n of his eyes to completely block the harmful light, whilst instead relying upon the enhanced perception of his other senses to compensate for his obstructed vision.

This released chakra is capable of great destruction, as shown from how these projectiles completely penetrated a considerable stone pillar, before continuing to damage the immediate surroundings.\n\nThe samurai have also shown the ability to use \nshape transformation\n during the implementation of this technique, sculpting their respective chakra blades into various rudimentary weapons that extend beyond the natural dimensions of their original swords; such as broadswords, \nspiked shafts\n and even axes. This capability allows them to rely on smaller swords reminiscent of \nwakizashi\n, while attaining greater reach, damage and the possibility of conducting surprise attacks as necessary.\n\nThis transformational quality also appears to extend to even the crescents of chakra launched from the blade, forming a diverse range of projectiles that includes giant \nbuzzsaws\n and shafts of chakra, the shape of which are seemingly dependent on the structure of the previously formed weapon.\n[\n1\n]"

For the episode of the same name, see \nSealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals\n is a technique that was used by \nPain\n and the other members of \nAkatsuki\n to forcibly seal a \ntailed beast\n \n[\n2\n]\n or to extract a still-living \njinchūriki\n's tailed beast chakra into the \nDemonic Statue of the Outer Path\n. The technique took three full days to complete if nine of the Akatsuki members were present. \nZetsu\n stated that if there are fewer people to perform the technique, it would take a while longer.\n[\n3\n]\n\n\nTo prepare for the technique, Pain would summon the Demonic Statue, after which each member would then stand on one of its fingertips, corresponding to their specific ring finger. When performed, this technique caused the bit to fall out of the mouth of the statue. Each of the Akatsuki members would then concentrate, causing the kanji of their rings to appear on the nail of the finger they were standing on. Nine dragon-like effigies then poured from the statue's mouth, surrounded the captured host, and painfully removed the tailed beast from them. In the case of an unsealed tailed beast, the same thing happened to the beast itself, and still took as much time as if it were sealed. After the process was complete, the beast was sealed within the statue, and one of the statue's nine eyes opened. The host would die due to the removal of their tailed beast. There is a numerical order, with the \nNine-Tails\n needing be sealed last, or the statue would shatter.\n[\n4\n]\n\n\nHowever, with Nagato now dead, \nTobi\n claimed that they would need a new pawn to synchronise with the Demonic Statue in order to seal the \nEight-Tails\n and the Nine-Tails.\n[\n5\n]\n Though Nagato intended to use it for peace in the form of a weapon of mass destruction to keep governments in line, the technique was created for \nMadara Uchiha\n's \nEye of the Moon Plan\n, as Obito was tasked with ensuring that the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and the tailed beasts would become the \nTen-Tails\n once more.\n\n\n\nSee Also\n[\n]\n\n\nSummoning: Demonic Statue of the Outer Path\n\n\nTail Releasing Method\n\n\nTailed Beast Removal Technique\n\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nSha no Sho\n, Page 294\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 329, page 8-9\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 419, page 11\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 353, page 5\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nNaruto\n chapter 450, page 9"

The seal must be placed at Rōen's weak point, on the back of its head. If successfully applied, Rōen's body gradually turns to smoke, which then travels to and is contained within the Kodon clan's shrine. Rōen will only remain imprisoned there for seven years, at which time the sealing must be performed anew. Kodon can release the seal before then if they choose.\n\nThe back of Rōen's head is covered with tentacles that shield the area and attack anyone who comes near, absorbing their chakra. Because of this, users require another person's help to distract Rōen while the seal is placed. Even with help, there's a good chance that the user will die trying to use the seal, or even immediately afterwards while Rōen's body still has form. If the seal isn't correctly applied, it will at least dull Rōen's movements, making it easier to try using the seal again.\n\nThe seal can also be used to confine Rōen within another's body; as with its typical use, the seal is placed at the back of the head. \nReishi Kodon\n's body was not compatible with Rōen, but his infant brother, \nKina Kodon\n, was. Doing this doesn't carry the seven year time limit, but it does link Rōen's chakra with Kina's: if ever the seal broke, Kina would die within ten minutes if a new seal couldn't be performed. As a curious side-effect, the seal also seemed to compel Kina to stay near the clan's shrine, preventing him and Reishi from relocating to a new home."

    "jutsu_description": "This article is about the jutsu. For the chapter, see \nShadow Clone Technique\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nShadow Clone Technique\n is a \nclone technique\n created by \nTobirama Senju\n.\n[\n3\n]\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n[\n]\n\n\nThis jutsu allows the user to create one or more copies of themselves. The user's \nchakra\n is evenly divided between themselves and their clones: creating one clone will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will give each a third of the user's chakra, and so on. Depending on how much chakra the user has and how many clones they make, this rapid depletion of their reserves can be dangerous. Because of this, usually only those of at least \njōnin\n-level can safely use the standard Shadow Clone Technique.\n[\n4\n]\n The \nMultiple Shadow Clone Technique\n – which creates hundreds of clones to the standard version's dozens – is unsafe to the point of being \nforbidden\n. \nNaruto Uzumaki\n is an exception to this rule; because he has access to the chakra of the \nNine-Tails\n, he can create hundreds of clones without worry.\n[\n5\n]\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nShadow clones' identical \nchakra pathway systems\n, seen with a \nByakugan\n.\n \n \n\n\nUnlike the basic \nClone Technique\n, shadow clones are physically real. They possess the same clothing, damage, and transformations as the user at the time of their creation. Most tools and weaponry are copied when the shadow clones are created,\n[\n6\n]\n but \ncertain chakra constructs\n[\n7\n]\n and \ncomplicated technology\n won't be duplicated.\n[\n8\n]\n Because they are visually identical and possess the same chakra as the user, shadow clones are indistinguishable from their original, not even by \ndōjutsu\n;\n[\n4\n]\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\n \nMadara Uchiha\n can identify shadow clones using his \nRinnegan\n.\n[\n11\n]\n\n\nOnce created, shadow clones can serve a number of purposes. They can be used as decoys, either by keeping opponents preoccupied or, because they can't be told apart, concealing the original's identity.\n[\n12\n]\n If enough shadow clones are created, they can simply overwhelm an opponent, pinning them down or attacking from multiple directions.\n[\n6\n]\n Shadow clones can also be used simply to assist the user, joining the user for tactics they can't do alone\n[\n13\n]\n or being sent to carry out tasks while the user is busy. Shadow clones possess all the same memories as the user, and so will react to unforeseen obstacles just as the user would in the same circumstances. Because they have their own chakra, shadow clones can perform other \njutsu\n, including making more shadow clones.\n[\n14\n]\n\n\nShadow clones usually disperse once they are struck hard enough, but they have been shown capable of enduring injuries for a time.\n[\n15\n]\n When a clone's task is completed, it can disperse itself or be dispersed by its user. Once dispersed, the clone's experiences and remaining chakra are transferred back to the user.\n[\n16\n]\n The shared experiences make shadow clones useful for intelligence gathering: a shadow clone can be sent into hostile territory, gather information without endangering the user, and disperse when finished, thus transferring what they've learned.\n[\n17\n]\n Alternatively, shadow clones can recon an area, dispersing when they've found what they're looking for in order to let the user know the target's location.\n[\n18\n]\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nNaruto using shadow clones to accelerate his \nnature transformation\n training.\n \n \n\n\nKakashi Hatake\n discovered that shadow clones can also accelerate training periods. For example, by training alongside one shadow clone for one hour, the user will have two hours' worth of training experience once the shadow clone disperses. By using hundreds of clones, training that would usually take weeks or months can be completed within a few hours.\n[\n19\n]\n But because of how much chakra it takes to create just one shadow clone, and because the training itself will likely be arduous even without shadow clones, only Naruto can train in this way.\n[\n20\n]\n Naruto is indeed able to make effective use of this shortcut, but the combined experiences come with combined mental fatigue, requiring that he take regular breaks.\n[\n21\n]\n\n\nAlthough they are separate, shadow clones maintain small links between themselves and their original, intended to allow the user to reestablish control when needed. Users can exploit this link to network their clones, causing changes in their own chakra to extend to all the others.\n[\n3\n]\n In certain cases, this link can work against the user, such as when pain caused by the Nine-Tails' chakra was felt by all of Naruto's shadow clones.\n[\n22\n]\n While a user and/or their clones are performing tasks that require concentration, they're unable to have more than a few shadow clones active at a time.\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\n In the novelisation of \nBoruto: Naruto the Movie\n, Naruto is consciously aware of what all his shadow clones around \nKonohagakure\n are doing. Although this allows him to have multiple conversations simultaneously, he has difficulty focusing on any one thing and the original Naruto becomes increasingly strained the longer the shadow clones are active; he drinks coffee and energy supplements in order to remain alert, but as soon as his concentration falters his shadow clones will all disperse."

The user can stretch their shadow however they wish in order to accomplish this goal, but they are limited by their shadow's surface area; if a target can move far enough away from the Shadow Imitation's user, they are theoretically safe from it. But there are ways around this: the user's shadow can freely move within other shadows, extending its range;\n[\n2\n]\n \nShikamaru Nara\n frequently uses \nflash bombs\n, either to briefly extend his own shadow or to extend his targets' shadows.\n[\n3\n]\n \nShikamaru Hiden\n clarifies that a user must have a shadow to manipulate, and so the Shadow Imitation cannot be used in utter darkness.\n\nOnce a user merges their shadow with a target's, the target cannot move on their own other than to talk. The only movements they are able to make are those that the user makes: if the user walks forward, the target walks forward; if the user raises their right hand, the target raises their right hand.\n[\n4\n]\n Nara tend to wear their \nshuriken\n holsters in atypical locations so that, when they reach for and throw shuriken, their targets will reach for and throw nothing.\n[\n5\n]\n Although most often used against opponents, the Shadow Imitation Technique can be used to save allies, freezing them in physically impossible positions so that they won't trigger booby traps\n[\n6\n]\n or causing them to cling to sheer surfaces with no means of support.\n[\n7\n]\n At times, the Shadow Imitation's mimicry is two-way, as if a third-party forces the target to make a move, the user will be forced to make the same move.\n[\n8\n]\n\n\nKeeping a target restrained requires a great deal of \nchakra\n, making it difficult to maintain the Shadow Imitation for long periods of time; in Part II, Shikamaru can only maintain it for five minute intervals.\n[\n9\n]\n With repeated use or against multiple targets, the duration of the binding becomes shorter.\n[\n10\n]\n If a target is strong enough or if the user is weakened enough, targets can resist and even overpower the Shadow Imitation's control. When that happens, Nara will inevitably use one of their other techniques, such as the \nShadow–Neck Binding Technique\n or \nShadow Sewing Technique\n.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n\n\nThe Shadow Imitation Technique was previously known as the \"Leaf Secret: Shadow Bind Technique\" (\n木ノ葉秘伝・影縛りの術\n, \nKonoha Hiden: Kageshibari no Jutsu\n, \nliterally meaning:\n Tree Leaf Secret: Shadow Bind Technique), which was only capable of restricting targets' movements.\n[\n13\n]\n The imitation aspect was apparently not added until after \nOrochimaru\n defected from \nKonohagakure\n, as his \nOtogakure\n invaders did not know about it prior to the \nKonoha Crush\n.\n[\n14\n]\n \nShikaku Nara\n still uses the old name sometimes.\n[\n13\n]\n Young Nara are initially only taught the Shadow Bind, with the Shadow Imitation not being learned until later; in the anime, being able to use the Shadow Imitation is considered a \nrite of passage\n within the Nara clan.\n[\n15\n]"

The user changes the shape of their shadow into several sharp tendril-like needles and controls each separately. They can then attack the same or several targets simultaneously and at the same time snatch away their ability to move by sewing them stuck with the shadow threads. Because it is a physical attack, it is impossible to capture someone without harming them, but on the other hand, since the speed of invocation and the time of duration are excellent, it can be used when urgent restraint is required.\n\nThis technique is usually used to go through the target and capture them, but depending on the opponent, it can also be used as an attack to bring them down. This special characteristic finds its greatest effect when used as logistical support. After this technique hits someone, it can then be directly transformed back into the Shadow Imitation Technique; conversely, after immobilising the target(s) with the latter technique, a proficient user can then also transition so into the Shadow Sewing Technique to thereby subsequently inflict harm to the captured party."

Karura's love for Gaara was so great that, in death, her spirit possessed the \nsands\n and used them to protect him.\n[\n2\n]\n Later that same day, Yashamaru, under orders of the \nFourth Kazekage\n, tried to assassinate Gaara. After his attack failed, Yashamaru told Gaara that he lied earlier: Karura did not love Gaara; she hated him.\n[\n3\n]\n The Shield of Sand, said Yashamaru, was a result of \nShukaku\n (\nsealed\n within Gaara) using the sand to keep Gaara, and thus itself, safe.\n[\n4\n]\n It isn't until many years later that the Fourth Kazekage confesses to Gaara that he ordered Yashamaru to lie: Karura truly did love Gaara and the Shield of Sand truly is her doing.\n[\n5\n]\n\n\nThe Shield of Sand reacts to any attack against Gaara, even those Gaara himself is not aware of. When he's about to be physically harmed in any way, the Shield of Sand moves between him and the threat in order to block it. Though most often used in shielding Gaara from enemies, the sand also protects him from self-inflicted injury.\n[\n2\n]\n The Shield of Sand is automatic, requiring nothing from Gaara to use and thus meaning it can operate indefinitely.\n[\n6\n]\n Because the shield is formed from sand that's been seeped in Gaara's \nchakra\n, it has a very fast response time, too fast for most enemies to overcome.\n[\n7\n]\n Some, such as \nRock Lee\n and \nSasuke Uchiha\n, are fast enough to outpace the sand, striking Gaara before it's able to shield him; it is against opponents such as these that he relies on his Armour of Sand for defence.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\n The combination of the armour and shield is an effective one, enabling Gaara to go years without the slightest injury.\n[\n10\n]\n\n\nThe Shield of Sand can protect Gaara against a great variety of threats, at different times defending him from \nkunai\n,\n[\n2\n]\n \nexploding tags\n,\n[\n3\n]\n \nSenbon Shower\n,\n[\n11\n]\n \ntaijutsu\n,\n[\n10\n]\n \nShikotsumyaku\n,\n[\n12\n]\n \nExplosive Clay\n,\n[\n7\n]\n and \nAmaterasu\n,\n[\n13\n]\n to name only a few. The sand itself is very good at absorbing the force from attacks, and so it is rarely even misshapen from the impact. On those infrequent occasions when attacks do push against the shield, it places enough of a buffer between it and Gaara to stop the blow before it reaches him.\n[\n12\n]\n Only incredibly fast, piercing attacks, notably the \nChidori\n, have been shown to actually break through the Shield of Sand and injure Gaara.\n[\n14\n]\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKarura manifesting as the shield.\n \n \n\n\nEven though the Shield of Sand ordinarily acts independently of Gaara, he is able to exert some control over it if he chooses.

The first three seals will light the seal up, allow the user to levitate, and create a barrier. The barrier will repel things from the outside, although Mōryō managed to enter at the cost of the life of his host, \nYomi\n. Also, the spheres inside the circle will begin to revolve around the circle.\n\nThe next nine seals will cause the gate-like seal leading to Mōryō's body to rise above the ground. This gate seems to be laid on its back.\n\nThe final six seals will release the seal on Mōryō's body, and it becomes accesible (to Mōryō). After reclaiming his body, Mōryō managed to break the barrier around the seal, as he mentions Yomi did not have the ability to do so.\n\nThe true effect of the sealing is that the user and the target being sealed will merge into one being. So that neither parties can utilise their chakra, the two minds are combined into one. Then one must absorb the other, as Mōryō did with Miroku (this gave to the rise of Mōryō in the first place, who was born from the darkness inside the hearts of people), and neither the user nor target can leave the shrine until this happens. Mōryō could not do the same with Shion due to the bell which contained the stone where Miroku sealed all of her powers into. Sacrifice is not really necessary, as the movie suggests that Miroku used this technique twice to seal Mōryō's body on opposite regions. Once completed, the tomb will store the victim for eternity.\n\nShion, however, knew nothing about this, instead believing the sealing technique will simply seal the demon away."

For the technique which uses different bodies, see \nSix Paths of Pain\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSix Paths Technique\n (\n六道の術\n, \nRikudō no Jutsu\n) is the origin of the unique techniques bestowed by the \nRinnegan\n. Those who wield the Rinnegan have access to each of these techniques.\n[\n2\n]\n Despite its name, there are actually seven of these techniques that grant the user powerful and near god-like abilities:\n\n\n\nThe \nDeva Path\n (\n天道\n, \nTendō\n), which is able to manipulate attractive and repulsive forces.\n\n\nThe \nAsura Path\n (\n修羅道\n, \nShuradō\n), which allows the user to augment their body with mechanised limbs, weaponry and armour.\n\n\nThe \nHuman Path\n (\n人間道\n, \nNingendō\n), which affords the ability to read a person's mind while also removing their soul.\n\n\nThe \nAnimal Path\n (\n畜生道\n, \nChikushōdō\n), which allows the user to \nsummon\n a wide variety of creatures.\n\n\nThe \nPreta Path\n (\n餓鬼道\n, \nGakidō\n), which is capable of absorbing all forms of \nchakra\n, including most ninjutsu.\n\n\nThe \nNaraka Path\n (\n地獄道\n, \nJigokudō\n), through which the user can call upon the \nKing of Hell\n.\n\n\nThe \nOuter Path\n (\n外道\n, \nGedō\n), with which the user is able to preside over life and death.\n\n\nNagato\n, who was crippled early in his lifetime, utilised the Outer Path to create the \nSix Paths of Pain\n: six reanimated corpses that he controlled as additional bodies through the use of \nblack receivers\n. These bodies each possessed copies of the Rinnegan and the ability to use one aspect of the Six Paths Technique, thus compensating for Nagato's physical limitations. The Six Paths of Pain were each named after the ability Nagato channelled through them, while Nagato himself was regarded as the seventh Pain, the Outer Path.\n[\n2\n]\n \nObito Uchiha\n would later make use of this method to create his own Six Paths of Pain, this time using six former \njinchūriki\n that were \nreincarnated\n by \nKabuto Yakushi\n.\n[\n3\n]\n\n\nAs the main body's vision is linked to the Rinnegan possessed by the corpses, this method allows the user to easily coordinate their movements and also offers them a form of protection, as they can control the corpses from a distance, rather than putting their own body at risk. However, in order to use some especially chakra-taxing facets of the Six Paths Technique, the user must either cut off the flow of their chakra to all but one body, as in the case of the large-scale \nShinra Tensei\n,\n[\n4\n]\n or bring the body close to their position, as in the case of \nChibaku Tensei\n.\n[\n5\n]\n In contrast, when a Rinnegan wielder uses the Six Paths Technique with their own body, they are capable of using multiple abilities at once, and the strength of the techniques are greater.\n[\n6\n]\n It also does not seem that the user is able to change the Path being utilised by each body, as once each of Nagato's Six Paths were taken down, he could not channel any of their powers through the remaining vessels.\n\n\n\nInfluences\n[\n]\n\n\nThe Six Paths share their names with the \nsix realms of reincarnation\n in Buddhism: Deva, Asura, Human, Animal, Preta, and Naraka. Each of these \"paths\" represents one of the realms a being may be reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated \nkarma\n of their past lives. While the two lower realms, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher realms, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be realms of suffering, as they perpetuate \nSaṃsāra\n, the cycle of reincarnation; the only way to break this cycle and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment.\n\nThe Outer Path, derived from the Sanskrit term \nTīrthika\n, refers to any doctrine that \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the \nNaidō\n (\n内道\n, \nliterally meaning:\n Inner Path), and is thus considered misguided and heretical."

The souls of both targets and users are separated from their bodies and confined to a special barrier. \nSensor\n ninja and even the \nByakugan\n cannot sense and see through this technique respectively. The targets are left in a state similar to suspended animation, still alive, but just barely, so much their chakra flow stops. To restore the trapped souls to their bodies, it is necessary to touch them with chakra. \nInoichi Yamanaka\n likens this to a \ngenjutsu cancel\n.\n\nInside the barrier, the souls of those trapped still feel like themselves, and are capable of using any techniques they know. Even if the casters of this technique are defeated it will not end. As such, it is only a matter of time before the life of those who are trapped by the barrier ends, as their physical bodies will eventually die. However, it sacrifices the lives of the users so the targets can be trapped and the users' malice is not blocked by the barrier so a ninja who can \nsense ill will\n can locate the barrier and break it, freeing the souls trapped within, while the users' disappears."

They practice all night to synchronise Kakashi's \nEarth Release\n with Yamato's \nWood Release\n, finding a configuration that is structurally sound but that also will reach the intended elevation within the one hour they'll be allotted.\n\nThe Spiralling Tower originally works as intended, with Kakashi's earth pillar and Yamato's wood pillar entwining in order to fortify each other as they grow into the sky. But a rainstorm begins shortly after they start, forcing Kakashi to spend additional chakra to reinforce the earth pillar against the rain and wind. The task eventually becomes too much for him and he loses sync with Yamato, briefly halting the tower's growth and potentially risking its destruction. \nGaara\n and \nKurotsuchi\n, whose assistance Kakashi requested the night before, arrive in time to assist, stabilising the tower that has been created so far and adding a \nsand\n pillar from Gaara and a second earth pillar from Kurotsuchi to its continued entwining growth.\n\nThe Spiralling Tower ends up being a success, with the \nthree-man team\n that was ascending it reaching their destination in time. At the conclusion of the three's mission, an impact at the peak topples the tower and causes debris to start falling on Konoha. Gaara attempts to use his sand to shield the village, but he has no additional chakra to do so.

Once the seal is formed, the user's already impressive chakra control allows them to perform techniques without any wasted energy.\n[\n4\n]\n When \nreleased\n, the seal will either spread across the user's face or wrap around their entire body.

It allows the caster to instantaneously shrink themselves or any nonliving matter within their field of vision (or return the same to full size) at will.\n\n\n\nOverview\n[\n]\n\n\nSukunahikona allows the user to physically shrink down themselves and objects within their sight, even energy and \nchakra\n-based substances, though living beings other than the user cannot be affected. Because the change in size happens too fast for the human eye to see (and the shrunken size can be exceedingly small), use of the jutsu can easily be mistaken for teleportation. The technique cannot, however, be used on oneself if one is physically paralysed. \nDaikokuten\n can be used to store shrunken objects within an alternate dimension where time does not flow, allowing them to maintain a pristine condition.\n\nIsshiki Ōtsutsuki utilised Sukunahikona while on the verge of death after being betrayed by Kaguya, to enter the body of \nJigen\n, which allowed him to survive as a parasite before ultimately taking over the monk's brain.\n\nIsshiki employs Sukunahikona in combat by shrinking his projectile attacks to keep his enemies from defending against them and then restoring them to their original size to inflict critical damage. He also uses the jutsu to dodge enemy attacks and free himself from restraints. He is still able to use \nKāma\n's absorption in his shrunken state. He can also use the shrinking effect defensively against that which Kāma cannot absorb, such as reducing natural (non-chakra) flames that were engulfing him to a small size. The shrinkage is not limited to an object's entirety, as Isshiki can shrink a section of the target object, such as causing a building to cave in or removing a section of a rooftop.\n\nWhile inhabiting Jigen's body, this jutsu demanded that Isshiki make hand gestures in order to shrink foreign matter, but in his original form, Isshiki can achieve the effect merely by looking at desired objects."

The oesophagus is summoned around a target; if this is done inside a cave or some other structure, it's possible the target will not even notice.

The user can create any number of arms that they desire and they can also serve other purposes such as grappling hooks, to either grab onto objects or enemies from great distances, for offensive means, as merely touching one of these can cause fatal burns, due to the Nine-Tails' seething hatred within its chakra (though this is not always the case). Due to having chakra attached to his body, the chakra arms can grow in size and from the \nfourth tail\n up, Naruto, the arms, or any part of his body can divide into two or more fully operational appendages.\n[\n3\n]\n \nKiller B\n has also been shown to use this technique though instead of arms, he can form horns which he uses for his \nLightning Release: Lariat\n technique.\n[\n4\n]\n\n\nIn his \nNine-Tails Chakra Mode\n, Naruto can use the chakra arms to a greater extent, as he can use and release chakra arms from anywhere on his body on a small or large scale. These arms even have the power to crush stone without Naruto putting much thought into it.\n[\n5\n]\n In the anime Naruto was able to crush a sword with a chakra arm just by tightening his grip.\n[\n6\n]\n After some practice, he mastered the chakra arms, able to manipulate various stones and geometric shapes without crushing them.\n[\n7\n]\n Now he is able to use them in an attempt to create a new technique: the \nTailed Beast Rasengan\n since he was advised by the \nEight-Tails\n against the use of \nshadow clones\n in this form.\n[\n8\n]\n Naruto's mastery of the Tailed Beast Chakra Arms is so great that he is able to \ncreate several at once\n to launch attacks at several enemies, use them to \npull enemies into\n the attack, and even \ncreate tiny ones around his finger\n. The arms also grant him a greater level of dexterity and manoeuvrability out of what would normally be a helpless situation,\n[\n9\n]\n such as guiding his Rasenshuriken during his fight against the \nThird Raikage\n.

Users will gain the attributes and physical features of whatever they transform into, such as a weapon's sharpness or an animal's fangs.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n To be able to assume so many different forms makes this technique invaluable for not just combat, but intelligence gathering and diversionary tactics as well.\n[\n1\n]\n In \nSasuke Shinden\n, some transformations are shown to take some getting used to, such as if the assumed form has a different height than the user or if the assumed form wears clothes that the user isn't accustomed to.\n\nBeing able to use the Transformation Technique does not necessarily mean one can use it well. Ideally, the user's transformation should be indistinguishable from the original, so that if they were placed together they could not be told apart. Inexperienced users, particularly \nAcademy students\n, will often have obvious discrepancies in their transformations, making them useless for deception.\n[\n1\n]\n Even practised users, though their transformations may lack any serious flaws, can overlook small details of whoever they're impersonating (such as minor scrapes or blemishes), thus enabling careful observers to expose them as impostors. Even if a transformation is a perfect likeness, users can still inadvertently reveal themselves if they don't act the same way as their subject.\n[\n4\n]\n Users can also be identified as fakes if their scent is wrong.\n[\n5\n]\n\n\nWhen a transformed user has been found out and attacked, they ordinarily allow the transformation to dispel. Some users may maintain the transformation in a final attempt to keep their cover, only dispelling the transformation once this effort fails.\n[\n4\n]\n Still other users may, when they seem to be dispelling the transformation, actually take another transformation altogether, confusing opponents as to their true identity. Seemingly the only way to reliably find out if somebody is using the Transformation Technique is to knock them unconscious, which will cause the transformation to dissolve.\n[\n6\n]\n\n\nTsunade\n uses the Transformation Technique to constantly appear several decades younger, keeping it active regardless of where she is or what she's doing. She only reverts to her original form when she no longer has the \nchakra\n to maintain her transformation.\n[\n7\n]\n In the anime, \nKagerō\n also keeps her Transformation Technique active for long periods of time, taking the form of a buck-toothed, hunchbacked man.\n[\n8\n]\n In \nAkatsuki Hiden\n, the citizens of \nShangri-la\n use the Transformation Technique at all times in a concerted effort to make new lives for themselves; their transformations only dispel when they die."

This training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra to the bottom of one's feet, and using it to climb a tree without using one's hands. If the stream of chakra is too weak, the user will lose their footing on the tree and fall off. If it is too strong, the user will be pushed away from the tree, causing the tree to fracture around the point of contact and the user will fall. The concept of this exercise is similar to magnetics. This is evidenced when \nSasuke\n was able to attract a \nkunai\n \nNaruto\n threw his direction to his feet and then throw it at an enemy by kicking the kunai while releasing his chakra's hold on the kunai."

    "jutsu_description": "This technique traps a target in a sphere of water; the water can either be drawn from the surroundings\n[\n2\n]\n or expelled from the user's mouth.\n[\n3\n]\n The water that the sphere is made from is noticeably heavy,\n[\n2\n]\n which restricts the target's movements and can make breathing difficult.\n[\n4\n]\n As such, those trapped within the water prison cannot ordinarily escape on their own. \nNeji Hyūga\n was able to free himself by simultaneously \nreleasing\n \nchakra\n from all of his \ntenketsu\n, destroying the prison.\n[\n5\n]\n In \nAkatsuki Hiden\n, \nKisame Hoshigaki\n escaped by \nincreasing the volume of water\n within the prison beyond what it could contain, causing it to burst.\n\nIn order to maintain the prison, users must stay in contact with the sphere, typically by keeping an arm submerged within it. For this reason, \nwater clones\n can be used in combination with water prisons, either by having the water clone attack other targets while the user maintains the prison,\n[\n6\n]\n or by having the clones themselves form the prisons, leaving the user free to act. In cases where a water clone forms the water prison, the water of the clone's body can be used as a source for the prison.\n[\n4\n]\n In the anime, this contact is shown to not be necessary, allowing users to trap targets from a distance,\n[\n7\n]\n and can draw in other people to trap upon contact with it.\n[\n8\n]\n\n\nThe water prison's usefulness has caused it to be adapted for other purposes. It can be stored in scrolls, trapping anyone who tries to read their contents without permission.\n[\n9\n]\n Alternatively, users can confine themselves within a water prison, thus preventing opponents from reaching them.\n[\n3\n]"

Regardless of the natural atmosphere around him, he could manifest many different weather effects, effectively turning them into powerful attacks or defences. It should be noted that his area of effect is not limited to outside, as he is able to isolate his abilities to relatively closed off areas, while within them. Yota has shown to have a great level of control over the range and direction of his ability, and could use them simultaneously if need be.\n\nThe following effects have been shown:\n\n\n\nRain\n: Once manifested, it could rain softly or fiercely, and could even be directed towards a single person. The rain itself seems to have an unusual effects on his opponents, as it is able to drain them of their chakra and vitality, while seemingly making them sad as well. Once produced in terms of offence and defence, he could summon varying sizes of very powerful, pressurised, water trenches to either block incoming attacks, restrain, or crush his opponents. He could even create huge water bubbles that attacks opponents with concussive force. Coming from many different directions, each of his attacks could manifest from anywhere within his vicinity, seemingly coming from thin air.\n\n\nSnow\n: Showing only the offensive capabilities, Yota is able to turn a simple snowfall into a powerful blizzard, enabling him to near instantly freeze everything around him, including people.\n\n\nLightning\n: Yota can produce large bolts of purple lightning. The lightning could be directed from anywhere, to anywhere the enemy is, and in rapid succession. It was fast enough to keep up with \nKiba Inuzuka\n and \nAkamaru\n. Should the lightning ever connect, it is powerful enough to instantly kill the target. However, if Yota wills it, the lightning can completely obliterate the target, even if it is the latter himself.\n\n\nWind\n: Yota is able to fully manipulate the direction and intensity of wind by whistling. He could summon anything from a concentrated tornado, to several whirlwinds. Each of these attacks have the offensive capabilities to slash and wound the intended target. It was powerful enough to cut, and catch off guard, \nNaruto Uzumaki\n, despite being in \nNine-Tails Chakra Mode\n.\n\n\nSunlight\n: Yota could also make the sun shine brightly. Although it hasn't been used offensively or defensively, it has shown to cause flowers to bloom quickly around him."

If the user doesn't have enough time to manifest the entire body, they can manifest a limb or two first to buy enough time for the full body to form.\n[\n3\n]\n It could even clash against the likes of \nMadara Uchiha\n's Complete Body — \nSusanoo\n, which was stated by Madara himself to have destructive powers rivalling even the \ntailed beasts\n.\n[\n4\n]\n\n\nIn the anime, it is capable of spawning multiple Wood Dragon heads, each capable of self-destructing.\n[\n5\n]\n\n\n\n\nInfluence\n[\n]\n\n\nThis technique seems to be based upon \nRyūtōki\n (\n竜燈鬼\n, \nDragon-Lamp Demon\n), a creature from Japanese folklores, who is typically depicted as a small \noni\n with a dragon coiled around its torso. Together with Tentōki (\n天燈鬼\n, \nHeavenly-Lamp Demon\n), the pair symbolise the power of the \nShitennō\n to repel and defeat evil.\n\nThe Buddhist monk \nKōben\n sculpted notable wooden statues of both Tentōki and Ryūtōki, which are each considered a National Treasure of Japan."
