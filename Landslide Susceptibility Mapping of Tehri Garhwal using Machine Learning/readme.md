# Landslide Susceptibility Mapping — Tehri Garhwal (Uttarakhand, India)

This project develops a machine-learning and remote sensing–based landslide susceptibility model for the Tehri Garhwal region in the Indian Himalayas.
Using DEM-derived terrain factors such as elevation, slope, and aspect, Sentinel-2 spectral indices, and landslide inventory data, the project generates both probability-based susceptibility maps and classified risk zonation maps to identify areas prone to landslides.

# 🎯 Objectives

Build a robust landslide susceptibility prediction model

Integrate multi-source geospatial datasets

Generate probability and classified risk maps

Provide a reproducible pipeline for landslide hazard assessment
